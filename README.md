* A sociological, time-bound analysis of crimes committed in Chicago, a city in the United States.
* Map Visualization with geohash library.
* Basic time series analysis on data, trend, seasonality etc.
* Evaluation of ADF and KPSS tests for the Stationarity Test
* Make the data Stationarity
* Determination of p,d,q variables of ARIMA model with ACF and PACF.
* Determining time-dependent variables and predicting possible crime intensities with the ARIMA time series model.
* Predicting the type of crimes that may occur with traditional machine learning models according to the location and time
* Making predictions by building Deep Learning models such as the 1D Convolution Model and LSTM.
* Revealing the regions where crime density has increased with the analyzes obtained from the data and the results of the emerging models.
